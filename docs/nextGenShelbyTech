YouTube Embedding & Search 

some way to pay $ to improve ranking within YT
alternate YT metadata DB

why does embedded youtube player suck?
 - post roll suggested video crap
 - annotations can be annoying
 - ads are annoying (can't do much about this)
 - youtube comments are only available on youtube
 - (comments on different sites, hard to index all the text related to a video)
 - as owner of site, i don't get any video analytics

questions 
 - how could we get all backlinks for a youtube video
 - how can we do this on mobile (iOS lib and HTML)?  html5 video?

analytics pitch
 - for people who don't make the video, but just link to it
 - use the Shelby embedded player, and then can log in to Shelby video analytics to see video usage on your site

search aspects (google image search flooding)
social aspects (pinterest, imgur)
possibly bloggers, etc. might want still images


other entirely separate products:

Interesting stuff within Shelby:
