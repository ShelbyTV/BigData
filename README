BigData - Scalable processing of Shelby data

The Shelby database has a lot of valuable data. Code contained here aims to process that data into a usable form.

Some applications may include:

 - video recommendations
 - users-to-follow recommendations
 - video sharing statistics
 - trending topics
 - etc.

The intention is that the code in this repository remain focused on processing Shelby database data and turning it into usable information.

Ideally, the code to display and/or perform additional manipulations of the processed data would be stored elsewhere.
